## Hashing

Hashing passwords essentially means that we're converting the user's password into another
string, which is one-way, and practically impossible to reverse.
To include additional security, it will then salt that string with random data, making
it even tougher to crack.


The username matches that of what I signed-up with, but if you notice, the password is a
rather long bunch of random data.
Since we used the standard password hashing from Werkzeug, it's applied a normal SHA256
method, which is just one way to salt a hashed password.

If you have something on your form like a multi-select dropdown list, that can be an
array of items, then you would use: 'request.form.getlist()' instead.
This would be helpful if you're grabbing multiple elements with the same name="" attribute,
such as various ingredients from a recipe for example.
