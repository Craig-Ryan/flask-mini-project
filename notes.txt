## Hashing

Hashing passwords essentially means that we're converting the user's password into another
string, which is one-way, and practically impossible to reverse.
To include additional security, it will then salt that string with random data, making
it even tougher to crack.

The username matches that of what I signed-up with, but if you notice, the password is a
rather long bunch of random data.
Since we used the standard password hashing from Werkzeug, it's applied a normal SHA256
method, which is just one way to salt a hashed password.
